# Intro Global Inequality

This is the Visual Introduction to the Data Storytelling Project about Global Inequality.

The objective is to transmit the situation in images.

Global inequality is all about the contrast of the "super rich" on the one hand and the increasing poverty on the othere hand.

#### Background

I got inspired by the work and research from Matthew Soules summarised in the book "Icebergs, Zombies and the Ultra Thin.
