# Intro Global Inequality

The objective is to transmit the situation in images.

Global inequality is all about the contrast of the "super rich" on the one hand and the increasing poverty on the othere hand.

I got inspired by the work and research from Matthew Soules summarised in the book "Icebergs, Zombies and the Ultra Thin.
